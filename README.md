Notes
-----

#### General startup times
* Initial `vagrant up` = approx 3 minutes
* Subsequent `vagrant provision` = approx 3 minutes

  *Note: Obviously this will vary extensively based on your system. This is just a rough idea. May take notably longer on very first `vagrant up` since apt-get data is not yet cached.*

#### General provision actions
* install various apt packages
* enable SSH forwarding, copy `~/.gitconfig` into VM

  *Note: All provision actions can be run repeatedly -- `vagrant provision` on a running system is expected to succeed.*
